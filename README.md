React hooks enable programmers to use react features without writting class components. they provide use of function componets instead of class components.
They make the code easier to understand and cleaner
useState hook() allows us to track state in a react componet
useEffect hook() allows you to perform side effects in your components such as manipulating the DOM or timers and fetching data
useRef() allows you to persist values between renders. it can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated. it can also be used to a DOM element directly.
useContext() provides a way to pass data or state through the component tree without having to pass props down manually through each nested component
